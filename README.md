# pOSt (pointless Operating System title)

A pretty useless (and pointless) 64-bit operating system, written in Rust. Thanks to 01000101 (that's their username) on the [OSDev forum](https://forum.osdev.org/viewtopic.php?t=15250) for the name suggestion. The core parts of the code are heavily based on Philipp Oppermann's [Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/) series.

Features (ranked by importance, most to least important):

- [ ] Doom!
- [ ] Shell
- [ ] Proper filesystem
- [ ] VGA/GOP graphics
- [ ] Scheduler
- [ ] Multiprocessing
- [ ] 32-bit support
